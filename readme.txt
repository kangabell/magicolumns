== Description ==
Columns of text that stretch to fit, with easy-to-use shortcodes.

== Installation ==
Easy to use and set up. After installing the plugin you can jump right in to using the shortcodes in the page/post editor.

This plugin creates a responsive layout. At small sizes (e.g. phones) the layout defaults to your theme's styles. The Magicolumns kick in at medium or larger sizes (tablets, laptops, desktops, etc).

Not recommended for use with fixed-layout (not responsive) themes.

== Shortcodes ==

Wrap around a region of text to create a container:
[mgc][/mgc]

Wrap around each element you'd like to be a column:
[col][/col]
